title: Smooth.js 0.1.5 Released

Yesterday I released [Smooth.js](https://github.com/osuushi/Smooth.js) version 0.1.5 . In addition to adding a
lot of tests and reworking some internals, we've got a couple spiffy new interpolation methods, scale-to-range,
and deep input validation. 

# New Interpolation Methods

We have two new interpolation methods: `'sinc'` and `'lanczos`' . The latter is actually a special case of the
former, as we will see.

## Windowed Sinc Filters

This is actually a whole class of filters based on the 
idealized construct known as the [sinc filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_filter). The true sinc filter
cannot be applied because the sinc function extends to infinity. But we can apply a window to the sinc function
to get a filter kernel that we can use for interpolation. To do this we use the `'sinc'` interpolation method.

There are two config parameters that control the sinc filter window: `sincFilterSize` and `sincWindow` .

`sincFilterSize` determines the interval in which the filter kernel is non-zero. The default is 2 corresponding
to the interval (-2, 2) .

`sincWindow` is a window function that you pass in. The window function must take one argument and return a
number.

Let's see some graphs!

Here are some points in two dimensions interpolated with a sinc filter with the default interval, and a 
Gaussian window function:

	function(x) {
		return Math.exp(-x*x);
	}

Here are the same points interpolated using this circular window function:

	function(x) {
		return Math.sqrt(1 - x*x/4);
	}

## Lanczos Resampling

A common and useful case of the sinc filter is 
[Lanczos resampling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_resampling) .
