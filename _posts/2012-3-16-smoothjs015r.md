title: Smooth.js 0.1.5 Released
---

![floatright](/images/smoothjs.png)
Yesterday I released [Smooth.js](https://github.com/osuushi/Smooth.js) version 0.1.5 . In addition to adding a
lot of tests and reworking some internals, we've got a couple spiffy new interpolation methods, scale-to-range,
and deep input validation. 

# New Interpolation Methods

We have two new interpolation methods: `'sinc'` and `'lanczos`' . The latter is actually a special case of the
former, as we will see.

## Windowed Sinc Filters

This is actually a whole class of filters based on the 
[sinc filter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_filter). 

## Lanczos Resampling

More dummy text blah blah blah

# Scale to range

Blah blah blah 

Blah blah bla Blah blah blah Blah blah blah

# Deep input validation
